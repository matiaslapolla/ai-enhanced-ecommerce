## 🔧 Development Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Local Development
\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
\`\`\`

### Environment Variables
No external APIs required - all features use mock data and simulated responses for demonstration purposes.

### Database Integration (Future)
Current implementation uses localStorage and mock data. For production deployment:
- Replace mock authentication with real auth provider (Auth0, Supabase, etc.)
- Integrate with database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for product catalog
- Connect payment processing with real payment providers
- Implement real AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic) for intelligent features

### Recommended Integrations
- **Database**: Supabase or Neon for PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth or Auth0
- **Payments**: Stripe, PayPal, or MercadoPago
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4 for conversational features
- **Image Processing**: Cloudinary or Vercel Blob for image optimization
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is optimized for deployment on Vercel:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with zero configuration
4. Add environment variables for production integrations

## 📝 Notes

This is a comprehensive demo platform showcasing modern e-commerce capabilities with AI integration. All AI features, payment processing, and external integrations are currently mocked for demonstration purposes. The codebase is production-ready and can be extended with real services and databases.

The role-based authentication system makes it easy to demonstrate different user experiences and access levels without complex setup requirements.
